# TorchDemos
Some torch demos mostly based on official torch examples with some extra features

# torch-demos
In https://github.com/dimkastan/TorchDemos/
I provide some modified examples from: https://github.com/torch/demos

# HEp-2 cell classification using transfer learning
... under preparation....
https://github.com/dimkastan/TorchDemos/HEp-2Classification
[In this example I am training several networks on HEp-2 cell images using publicly available datasets (see ICPR2012, ICIP2013 and ICPR2014 HEp-2 cell contests)]
In particular in these examples I am experimenting with the following:
a. Transfer Learning (How transferable are the features from a network trained on a different task)
b. Training from scratch. (How is it possible to train a Deep CNN from scratch and how this compares to case (a)).
